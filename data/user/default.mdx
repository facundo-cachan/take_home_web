I am Facundo Cachan, as you may have already read, I am a web and application designer and developer, both for the web and for mobile phones, that is, for your phone.

This site is the product of some of the things I learned about the world of programming and new technologies, and more importantly thanks to the contribution of a colleague.

I got into development because computers have always fascinated me, just seeing that from a blank text document, with some code it becomes things that we use regularly, like Instagram or Mercado Libre was nothing less than magical for me and there It's where my quest to began.

I created this website so I could showcase all of this and, through this process, make it easier to connect with me. If you like what you see, write to me on any of my social networks and we'll chat for a while.
